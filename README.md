# bad-snake
bad-snake is a little sdl project, where I attempted to recreate the famous game Snake.

## Building instructions
You will need to download the official SDL2 dlls and c# bindings, you only need the classic SDL2 dll and respective binding, so no SDL2_ttf or SDL2_images. You can get the bindings from SDL2-CS or use the NuGet package Sayers.SDL2.Core.
